                        <span class="hl">Daniella "Saffron" Youkhana</span> is a digital artist born and raised in
                        California, who is presently
                        calling Portland, Oregon home. She is currently attending Arizona State University to obtain a
                        BA in Digital Culture, and previously attended the University of California, Santa Cruz where
                        she studied Video Game Design. At ASU and in her free time, she intends to study a wide variety
                        of topics and focus her degree towards: 2D and 3D game design, 3D animation, digital
                        illustration, character design, and digital accessibility. At present, her creative interests
                        lie in fantasy character art and digital painting, and with Japanese anime being one of her
                        first and biggest (and still current) inspirations, she intends to try her hand at producing fan
                        merchandise.

                        Outside of art, Daniella works as a barista at Starbucks and is actively part of the union
                        organizing committe at her store. Gaming takes up a large portion of her free time, whether it
                        be casual playing a video game, or developing lore in her various TTRPG campaigns. Fiction and
                        fantasy are a huge driving force for Daniella; it is safe to assume that at any given time, one
                        could fine her immersed in fiction.
