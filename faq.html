                    When did you start drawing?
                </h3>
                <h3 class="faq-t">
                    Some of the earliest (and fondest) memories I have of drawing are from middle school, when I would
                    stay up too late watching anime on the weekends with my best friend, exchanging doodles with each
                    other. I know I've loved art since a young age; I spent all of my time in school drawing, including
                    all over my notes and homework. I drew in MS Paint with my mouse before I was gifted my first
                    tablet. I was glued to my computer back then, drawing and drawing and sharing it with friends. As I
                    grew older and life came with more responsibilities, as mroe and more people told me I wasn't good
                    enough for an art career, the time I spent drawing was nearly zero. It wasn't until recently that I
                    started drawing consistently again. When did I start drawing? When I was little, of course, but when
                    was I reminded that it's never too late to pick something back up and try again, especially if you
                    love it? Now. I'm 28 years old and I'm excited to be growing again and working my way towards an art
                    career.

                <h3 class="faq-t">
                    So many things! The ADHD has made me try it all, but I've come to realize that as long as whatever
                    I'm doing involves creativity, then I enjoy doing it. At work, I try to find some extra time to make
                    fun, new drink recipes and practice latte art. At school, I've been focusing on web design and going
                    down the list of Adobe Creative Suite programs. At home, you can find me cooking, gardening, playing
                    games, watching shows, or spending time with my friends and pets.

                    What software do you use?
                </h3>
                <h3 class="faq-t">
                    I primarily use Clip Studio Paint to draw. I'm using a lot of Photoshop for school, but I'm not
                    ready to move over to PS for drawing yet. Too many brushes I'd have to replace... and the 3D feature
                    is so nice... Maybe one day!
